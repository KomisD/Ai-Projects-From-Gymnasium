# AI-Playing-Games: Reinforcement Learning Showcase

## About the Project

Welcome to my AI-Playing-Games repository! This project is a personal showcase demonstrating my skills in developing artificial intelligence agents capable of playing and mastering various games. The repository features AI implementations for three classic games: Pac-Man, Kung Fu, and Lunar Landing, using advanced reinforcement learning techniques within the Gymnasium framework.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections, each representing an individual game with its unique AI approach:

1. **Pac-Man** - Implemented using Deep Convolutional Q-Learning.
2. **Kung Fu** - Utilized Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C).
3. **Lunar Landing** - Employed Deep Q-Learning for strategic decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- GPU access (recommended for faster processing)

### Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/AI-Playing-Games.git
cd AI-Playing-Games
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Navigate to each game's directory to find the specific AI implementation. Each directory includes:

- `ai_agent.py` - The AI agent's code.
- `environment.py` - Game environment setup.
- `train.py` - Script for training the AI agent.
- `evaluate.py` - Script for evaluating the agent's performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language.
- Gymnasium: For creating and managing game environments.
- PyTorch: For implementing and training neural network models.
- Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: Deep Q-Learning, Deep Convolutional Q-Learning, and A3C.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes

- Develop a deep understanding of various reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Optimize AI agents for high performance in complex tasks.
- Experiment with the different parameters and how agents act to them.
